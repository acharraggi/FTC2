# FTC2
Test Android app. Displays various status things like Wifi, battery, sensors.

First Tech Challenge (FTC) is moving from Lego Mindstorms to Android for the coming robot competition year.
So this is my first Android app to learn about Android.

Developed using Android Studio 1.2.1.1
Tested on a cheap RCA 7" tablet while we wait for our new ZTE Speed phones.
